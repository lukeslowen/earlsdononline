          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zone  One consists of the 251 plots laid out in eight streets by the Coventry  Freehold Land Society in 1852.&nbsp; The  streets were paved and each plot provided with a water supply from the Spon End  artesian well and drainage for waste and rain water but no provision for sewage  disposal.&nbsp; The plots were to be allocated  to members of the Coventry Freehold Land Society by ballot.&nbsp; One of the first plots to be allocated went to  John Flinn, a member of the committee of the Freehold Land Society, who built  Earlsdon House (now Stoneleigh House) on a prominent site in Earlsdon Street.&nbsp; </font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  early development of the new &lsquo;garden village&rsquo; suburb of Earlsdon was slow and  uneven with one or two houses being erected in a street while other plots  remained vacant sometimes for many years. Nineteen years later in 1871 only 114  houses had been built on the 251 plots.&nbsp;  The slow erratic development of Earlsdon reflected the City&rsquo;s economic  decline between 1860 and 1890.&nbsp; Coventry has few  substantial Victorian houses or commercial premises in the city centre.&nbsp; The ribbon industry, the basis of Coventry&rsquo;s prosperity, was  almost destroyed by the Franco-British free trade treaty of 1861.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two  weavers who could afford to move to the new garden village of Earlsdon were  George Pool and David Green who built their houses next door to each other in  Cromwell Street (89 and 91 Berkeley Road South). The houses are typical  weavers&rsquo; houses with a topshop on the third floor.&nbsp; The topshop had reinforced floors to take the  weight of the heavy looms on the second floor and large windows to the front to  make maximum use of the daylight.&nbsp; The  1861 census records a further twenty-six other workers in the weaving industry  on the new estate.&nbsp; Some of them were  living on the other side of Cromwell    Street and working in a specially built shed in  the rear of the gardens.&nbsp; By 1868 most of  the workers in the weaving industry had been forced to leave the estate and  return to live in the cheaper housing in Coventry.&nbsp; </font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As  the ribbon industry declined, the watch industry enjoyed a slow and erratic  expansion until the 1880s when the industry entered its final period of  decline.&nbsp; The artisans employed in the  watch industry between 1850 and 1880 could afford to move to the new garden  village; approximately two thirds of the population in Earlsdon were employed  in the watch industry.&nbsp; </font></p>

          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  early residents of Earlsdon were united by their employment in the watch  industry; their exemption from the local rate of Coventry; pride in the ability to manage  their own affairs and the clean and healthy environment of Earlsdon.&nbsp; Many residents also shared their religious  beliefs and political affiliation.&nbsp; The  unity of the early residents is expressed in the erection of the Methodist Church (now the Criterion Theatre) in  1884.</font></p>
