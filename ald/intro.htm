        <td valign="top" width="50%"><p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  concept of Areas of Local Distinctiveness was introduced in the Coventry  Development Plan 2001 as a means of creating local design guidance for areas  outside the existing Conservation Areas in partnership with local  communities.&nbsp; A pilot study was  successfully concluded in August 2003 with the granting of Area of Local  Distinctiveness status to Spon End and Nauls Mill.&nbsp; The Coventry Development Plan 2001 suggested  that Earlsdon be considered for Area of Local Distinctiveness status following  the successful conclusion of the pilot study in Spon End and Nauls Mill.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  motivation to apply for Area of Local Distinctiveness for Earlsdon came from  the local community who were and are concerned that the local environment could  be adversely affected by developments which lack that quality and character to  fit comfortably with local Victorian and Edwardian architecture.&nbsp; A very well attended public meeting in July  2003 provided the impetus for the formation of a small committee of  volunteers.&nbsp; This committee soon realised  that the future of the local environment would best be protected by Area of  Local Distinctiveness status.&nbsp; An initial  meeting was held with the representatives of the planning department in April  2004.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlsdon  has mixed socio-economic population and housing.&nbsp; The housing in some streets is mostly owner  occupied; in others the housing is tenanted or has been converted into  apartments; some of the larger properties have been converted into houses in multiple  occupation.&nbsp; Some streets are largely  occupied by students who form a transitory population which can threaten the  viability of local services such as schools.&nbsp;  A local environment with a sense of history and identity expressed in  its buildings could influence some of these students to remain in Earlsdon providing  an intellectual resource for Coventry.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  conservation and enhancement of the area as recommended in this study will have  a positive effect on the population mix and the prosperity of the area.&nbsp; Earlsdon has a considerable amount of good  quality Victorian and Edwardian housing; information from estate agents  suggests that period houses in good condition with original details sell at a premium.&nbsp; These houses attract younger, high income  couples and families on whom the future of Earlsdon and Coventry may depend.&nbsp; The increased purchasing power of the  younger, high income couples would support and sustain local services such as  schools, shops and leisure activities, and provide an intellectual and academic  resource for the city.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following  full public consultation the final approved document will constitute  Supplementary Planning Guidance.&nbsp; There  are limits, however, as to what can be achieved through Planning Guidance.&nbsp; The protection of the detailed design aspects  of older properties and shop fronts cannot be guaranteed through current  legislation, unless, in the case of older properties, they are statutorily  listed.&nbsp; Many of the listed &nbsp;features that make up local distinctiveness &ndash;  such as door and window details, trees, paths and garden-walls are not normally  subject to any planning control.&nbsp;  Conservation Area Status gives limited additional control.&nbsp; This means that other tactics will have to be  used to protect small-scale details on which the character of the area often  depends.&nbsp; It is essential, however, that  where it can be justified, full use is made of existing planning powers if  local distinctiveness is to be protected.</font></p></td>
