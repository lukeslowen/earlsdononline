        <td valign="top" width="50%"><p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This report was prepared by members of ECAD,  Earlsdon Conservation and Development.&nbsp;  ECAD was formed in 2003 in response to a controversial planning  application for a site on Warwick    Street.&nbsp;  Following a series of public meetings and discussions between ECAD and  the Developer, the application was withdrawn and a scaled down proposal was  resubmitted which was subsequently approved.&nbsp;  Since then ECAD has monitored planning applications for significant  sites with a view to ensuring that proposed developments are in keeping with  the scale, style and character of the Earlsdon area.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the last twenty years the rate of  change in Earlsdon has increased significantly.&nbsp;  Earlsdon, in a way, is a victim of its own popularity.&nbsp; It is a popular area to live in and to  visit.&nbsp; This has caused a marked increase  in traffic and its attendant parking problems.</font></p>
          <p align="center"><img width="428" height="75" src="aldgr/image004.jpg"></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last five years developers have noted  the popularity of Earlsdon and have bought and developed a number of  significant sites.&nbsp; The developments have  been almost exclusively one or two bedroomed apartments with very little family  accommodation being provided.&nbsp; Generally  the architectural style has been a pastiche of the Victorian vernacular.&nbsp; None of them has been able to achieve the  building quality, particularly brickwork, which our forefathers consistently  achieved.&nbsp; </font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over 250 photographs were taken in the  preparation of this report.&nbsp; They were  gradually reduced as each zone was studied in terms of architecture and  accompanying text.&nbsp; The aim has been to demonstrate  photographically the overall architectural quality of the buildings, their  materials and details.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="center"><img width="151" height="192" src="aldgr/detail6.jpg"></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a contrast to the hard profiles of  buildings Earlsdon&rsquo;s other main character is one of a green suburb.&nbsp; Earlsdon was known as &lsquo;the garden suburb&rsquo; and  is still referred to as &lsquo;the village&rsquo;.&nbsp; Many  of the streets are tree lined backed up by mature well cared for gardens.&nbsp; Additionally, the whole area is surrounded by  swathes of green open space from the Kenilworth Road Conservation Area, War Memorial    Park, Spencer Park, Hearsall Common, Canley Ford  to the fairways of Hearsall Golf Club. It is this combination of mature  landscape, small scale red brick buildings and larger scale more formal  buildings which gives Earlsdon its distinctive character.&nbsp; </font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In terms of Design Guidelines we have grouped  the five zones into a single area because the development history of the zones  began in 1852.&nbsp; Before that year the area  was outside the city boundaries and consisted of open fields, a few farm  buildings and two lanes &ndash; Whor    Lane which became Beechwood Avenue and Elsdon Lane which became Earlsdon Avenue.&nbsp; Development, therefore, started in the mid  Victorian period and defines the architectural style.&nbsp; In recent years the buoyant housing market  has allowed home owners to improve or extend their properties.&nbsp; This has resulted in a variety of different  solutions which have tended to weaken the character of the street scene.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example many natural slate roofs are over  100 years old and have reached the point where they need replacing.&nbsp; The old slates have been replaced with a  variety of concrete tiles which have different profiles and colours.&nbsp; More recently synthetic slate tiles have  become popular.&nbsp; External walls have been  rendered, pebble dashed or painted (in some instances even terracotta details  have been painted over).&nbsp; Original  windows and doors have been replaced with UPVC versions.&nbsp; Front gardens have been paved over to provide  parking spaces.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many residents living in Victorian/Edwardian  properties are not aware or do not understand the correct way of dealing with  lime built structures.&nbsp; Within the Spon  End, Nauls Mill ALD document there is essential reading for homeowners of  Victorian/Edwardian buildings.&nbsp; We  recommend that a similar authoritative document is produced by the City Council  especially to give guidance to home owners when wishing to make changes to  their properties.&nbsp; It is hoped that a  City Council Guidance Document would help home owners to follow a range of  solutions which could be applied to properties of the pre 1920s era and would  help to achieve a more consistent quality of conservation.&nbsp; The correct maintenance and conservation of  buildings is vital for preserving the quality and heritage of Earlsdon.</font></p>
          <p align="center"><img width="151" height="349" src="aldgr/detail7.jpg"></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ALD status would strengthen the planning  process and would ensure the proper design approach to existing buildings where  an application for a change of use was sought.&nbsp;  Similarly it would give planners and residents a higher level of design  expectation when considering applications for new developments.&nbsp; It would also ensure that the shopping area  maintained a varied mix of shop types which would cater for all local needs.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Earlsdon now stands within the city  boundaries it still contains all the attributes of a &lsquo;village&rsquo; &ndash; church,  school, public house, shops and a range of dwellings from simple &lsquo;two up/two down&rsquo;  terraces with direct access onto the street to more substantial detached  properties.&nbsp; As such&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlsdon is representational of our  Victorian heritage nationwide. </font></p>
