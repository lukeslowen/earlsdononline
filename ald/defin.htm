            <li>
              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That       the area was clearly identifiable and was determined by clear boundaries.</font></p>
            </li>

              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That       the streets included buildings and other features worthy of recognition.</font></p>

              <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That       the streets included did not already hold other designations, e.g.       Conservation Area status.</font></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On  this basis it was decided to divide the Earlsdon Area of Local Distinctiveness  into five zones.&nbsp; Each zone represents a  stage in the growth of Earlsdon and contains good, typical examples of  architecture from the mid-Victorian period to the end of the Edwardian  period.&nbsp; The five zones are contained  within an area bounded by Beechwood    Avenue to the south and west, the  Coventry/Birmingham railway line to the north and the Kenilworth Road  Conservation Area to the east.&nbsp; In a few  instances other examples of distinctive buildings have been included which are  outside of these boundaries. The  working party agreed that the starting point should be the original eight  streets laid out by the Coventry Freehold Land Society, i.e. Earlsdon Street, Moor Street, Warwick  Street, Clarendon Street,   Arden Street, Providence Street, Berkeley  Road South and a short stretch of Earlsdon    Avenue South.&nbsp;  These streets were developed from 1852 and form Zone One.</font></p>
