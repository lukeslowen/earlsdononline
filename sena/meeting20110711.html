    <h2>Notes From The SENA Meeting of 11 July 2011</h2>

    <h3>Introductions</h3>

    <p>Cynthia Barnes and Kevin Noble were welcomed to this second
    meeting of SENA.</p>

    <h3>Other Earlsdon Neighbours Associations – their issues and
    organisation</h3>

    <p>Cynthia outlined the development of Rochester Road Association,
    initially founded in 1990 in response to the proposed development
    of the light railway.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>RARA has a constitution and all residents are members unless
      they opt to withdraw.</li> 
      <li>The association’s regular activities are an annual general
      meeting (with wine and cheese and invited speakers) and three
      annual fundraising activities – carol singing, open gardens and
      a garage and garden sale.</li> 
      <li>Communication is via two newsletters a year and the annual
      general meeting at St. Barbara’s Church hall. AGM guest speakers
      have included, for example, the city architect, city council
      representatives, the police. </li> 
      <li>Recent issues raised by RARA have related, for example, to
      planning, licencing, parking, traffic calming and neglectful
      landlords.</li> 
      <li>RARA also seeks to work with other local groups such as
      Friends of War Memorial Park
      and <a href="http://www.ecad.org.uk/">ECAD</a> on Earlsdon-wide
      issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cynthia drew our attention to some of the risks of a
    well-established group – sustaining momentum, recruiting new
    members and, in RARA’s case, a small number of people doing most
    of the work.</p> 

    <p>Kevin outlined some of the key features
    of <a href="http://www.earlsdon.org.uk/nena/index.htm">North
    Earlsdon Residents Association</a> which was formed eighteen
    months ago.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Residents become members by "declaring an interest" and
      joining the mailing list.  There is no fee to join.</li> 
      <li>Communication is via e mails two or three times a month, via
      street representatives and sometimes also via knocking on doors,
      depending on the issue.</li> 
      <li>NENA meetings are held every two months at
      the <a href="http://www.criteriontheatre.co.uk/">Criterion
      Theatre</a> with guest speakers.  There are also regular
      meetings of the street representatives and committee meetings
      (chair, vice-chair, events co-ordinator, secretary, Treasurer,
      fund raising officer)</li>
      <li>Kevin emphasised the importance of a diverse range of
      activities and initially, residents were canvassed about what
      they wanted to be involved in. Many of the street
      representatives are active on particular issues – not everything
      is organised by the committee. In June, NENA held a picnic in
      the park and a (second) very successful street sale.</li> 
      <li>Longer term developments have included tree planting (and
      developing an inventory of trees with the city council) and the
      redevelopment of Spencer Park. The biggest ongoing issue at
      present is the impact of Friargate. Like RARA, NENA seeks to
      work collaboratively with other groups on Earlsdon-wide
      issues. </li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>Kevin offered to help SENA in its initial setting up process –
    an offer gratefully accepted.</p>

    <h3>SENA – setting the agenda</h3>

    <p>Following these two very helpful presentations there was a
    general discussion on what the implications might be for SENA.  We
    don’t have a definable centre or social area – a village green or
    a park - nor do we have a unifying issue. However, we have had a
    good response to the first mailshot (better than the initial
    response from NENA residents for example) and an encouraging
    number of residents seeking active involvement.</p>

    <p>From the responses to the first mailshot and the first meeting
    it was clear that there were positive  things that residents
    wanted:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A voice</li>
      <li>A listening ear (delegates to go to meetings such as of the
    neighbourhood forum, the police, NENA and report back to
    residents</li> 
      <li>A social network</li>
      <li>Opportunities to be more inclusive; welcoming new neighbours
    in their neighbourhood; involving students</li>
      <li>Working collaboratively with other Earlsdon
    associations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We agreed we need an executive/management group and street
    representatives (preferably two) for every street. Initial
    volunteers for street representatives are</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Styvechale Ave</dt>
      <dd>Moya and Deryck Horton, Sally Vernon</dd>
      <dt>Warwick Avenue</dt>
      <dd>Mary and Nigel Lee</dd>
      <dt>Berkeley Road South</dt> 
      <dd>Simon Shaw </dd>
      <dt>Osborne Road</dt> 
      <dd>Ray Wilson</dd>
      <dt>Beechwood Avenue</dt> 
      <dd>Judith Hyman</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Other streets do not as yet have a rep.</p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>

    <p>Early communication structures have been put in place. Simon
    has constructed a Facebook page, and Matthew has set up a SENA
    website.</p>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>

    <p>It was agreed that we now needed a second maildrop to ask
      residents to:</p> 
    <ol>
      <li>Opt in to membership</li>
      <li>Evaluate the issues already suggested following the first
  mailing and the first two meetings</li>
      <li>Contribute to a skills bank</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A working group of Deryck, Simon, Ray, Matthew and Sally, Mike
    and Helen agreed to meet on Monday 18th July to shape the
    newsletter.</p>
