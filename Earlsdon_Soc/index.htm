      <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Earlsdon Society and Earlsdon Research Group </font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  present Earlsdon Research Group has, over time, been known by three different  titles . . .&nbsp; its first being the  Earlsdon History Society. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In  the autumn of 1977 Graham Partridge, then branch Librarian at Earlsdon Library  calculated, as a result of local research he had been undertaking, that  Earlsdon&nbsp; &lsquo;village&rsquo;&nbsp; most probably began to rise up from local  fields&nbsp; around the year 1853 and that, consequently,&nbsp; the following year (1978) would be Earlsdon  Village&rsquo;s 125th Anniversary. He suggested that, perhaps, local people might be  interested in organising an event the following summer to celebrate the occasion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What  followed was extraordinary, with all Earlsdon&rsquo;s then, many, charitable, sports  and social groups, as well as the majority of local residents coming together  to plan organise and participate in the two-week long, life-enhancing community  festivity in the summer of 1978 that was to be known as&lsquo;Earlsdon 125&rsquo; . It is  enough perhaps to remember that the membership of the&nbsp; weekly committee meetings which co-ordinated  the many Festival events was made up of the chairmen/women of the various event  subcommittees and that this co-ordinating committee alone had a final  membership of 27 people. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At  the initial planning meeting I volunteered to draw together a small group to  research the background, building and development of the &lsquo;village&rsquo; and to  uncover as many personal memories and photographs&nbsp; as we could of the years since the 1850&rsquo;s.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&lsquo;Earlsdon  125&rsquo; was a huge success and, after it had passed, and at the time that its  various planning groups were tidying everything up and closing their Minute  Books, the History Sub-Committee came to the conclusion that its work was still  on-going. So (in the autumn of 1978) new and existing members of the Group  formed The Earlsdon History Society to continue uncovering, cataloguing and  recording the history and life of these few streets on the south-west edge of the  City of Coventry. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In  1983 I and my family left Earlsdon and in 1984 the Earlsdon History Society was  disbanded but not before valuable historical data, photographs and artifacts  had begun to be rescued, catalogued and preserved.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In  1998 an exploratory meeting initiated by Mary Montes and others was held to  explore the setting up of a society which would have a particular interest in  local history whilst also carrying a more general brief for Earlsdon matters.  Thus was born &lsquo;The Earlsdon Society&rsquo; which for nine years, until it disbanded  in 2007,&nbsp; held regular monthly meetings  on matters of both local and a more broad historical interest. At the same time  the Society&rsquo;s committee continued the valuable work of the original group by  researching, collating, preserving and exhibiting the history and on -going  changes of the area. No&nbsp; other community  recognising the importance of honouring its history and development can owe a  greater debt to any member of that community than Earlsdon does to the late  Mary Montes and William Dunn who have between them, and for more than thirty  years, compiled in both word and picture one of the most comprehensive of  neighbourhood archives to be found anywhere in the whole of this country. Work  which William (Bill) still now sustains following the sad death of Mary in  2007.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I  returned to live in Earlsdon in 2001 and was delighted to be invited to assist  &lsquo;The Earlsdon Society', through its third metamorphis and become the convener of  the Earlsdon History Research Group. Time and age move us all on and whilst  continuing our watching brief and our exhibition presentations we group members  are now focusing on the task of making certain that Earlsdon&rsquo;s historical  records and artifacts (we hold street maps and directories, some house and  business deeds and plans and a photographic record covering 150 years)&nbsp; are preserved for posterity whilst, at the  same time taking pains to guarantee their continuing&nbsp; local accessibility. . .&nbsp; .&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and,  in addition,&nbsp; if any member of  present-day Earlsdon can invisage a developing or new role for our group we  would be delighted to hear from you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&lsquo;Community&rsquo;  is by its very nature intangible and Earlsdon&rsquo;s is certainly very different  from the nature of that one that still existed here as late as the 1970&rsquo;s. Yet,  on a dark evening it is still possible to walk down Earlsdon Avenue South or  along Mayfield Road and be greeted by a cheery &lsquo;Good-night!&rsquo; Earlsdon is a  special place, built as a village in rural Warwickshire for political purposes  and to provide accommodation for Master watch-makers and their in and out  workers and, even after becoming attached to Coventry at the beginning of the  20th century and almost 160 years of life, still&nbsp; retaining a sense or rural character and  &lsquo;difference&rsquo;.&nbsp; We can prove it - we have  the photographs!</font></p>
