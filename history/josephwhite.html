			  <h1>Joseph White <strong>1836-1906 </strong></h1>
			  <p align="center"><img src="/history/images/white.jpg" alt="Joseph White" width="236" height="352" /></p>
			  <p>Joseph White is probably one of the best known of the 'Earlsdon Manufacturers'. He was born in Foleshill in 1835, son of a weaver, and was  indentured to Chapelfields watchmaker Nathaniel Hill from the age of 14. His apprenticeship was for  seven years during which he worked a 12-hour day, six  days per week. In 1860, two years after his  apprenticeship ended, Joseph married, moved to a small  house in Mount Street, Chapelfields, and started his  own business. He was thus on his way to a  notable career in the manufacture of high-quality high-precision timepieces, and subsequently  to remarkable achievements in other areas as  well, including bicycle production, land  development and (through one of his sons), engine  manufacture (White &amp; Poppe).</p>
			  <p align="left">His watchmaking business prospered and  after a series of house moves, each one ‘upwards’,  he<br />
		      eventually bought <a href="/history/earlsdonhse.html">Earlsdon House</a>, Earlsdon, together with a row of <a href="/history/flinnscottages.html">workers cottages</a>. All this at the age of 32. The British watchmaking industry was now  nearing its peak, and by the 1870s Coventry was  producing two-thirds of all timepieces made in  Britain. Joseph White was specialising in the higher  quality sector of the market, striving always to meet the  most exacting demands. His company regularly entered  watches and chronometers for the rigorous  timekeeping trials organised by the Greenwich Royal Observatory and the Admiralty, and consistently featured high in the tables of performance  published by both. In 1911, in fact, a White watch  was placed first in trials by the Admiralty. The  highest quality watches made by White incorporated the  famous tourbillon device developed by Breguet and  designed to compensate for variations in timekeeping  which occurred when a watch changed its position  from vertical to horizontal.</p>
			  <p align="left">But the British watchmaking industry was  coming under increasing competition from abroad.  Import tariffs were being abolished, and the USA  in particular was ‘automating’ watch  production, introducing interchangeability of  components, and by launching the ‘dollar watch’, for  example, was bringing a pocket timepiece within the  reach of all. White continued to produce the highest  quality watches but his business acumen also made  sure his Company diversified, firstly by taking an  interest in Coventry Machinists Works (later Swift  Cycles), and then by buying land in Earlsdon and  developing it
			    for upmarket houses.</p>
			  <p>White had 12 children. In 1899, one of his sons, Alfred James  White, went into partnership with Peter August  Poppe, to found White &amp; Poppe, and Joseph was  involved in that venture as well. W  &amp; P went on to prosper. At its peak, the  Company was producing petrol engines in very large  numbers for use by a number of world-famous car  makers. After World War One,White &amp; Poppe was bought by  Dennis Brothers, Guildford, and in 1926 Harry  Harley (later Sir Harry) bought Joseph White &amp; Son  and with it Earlsdon House. Harley eventually  discontinued watch manufacture, and Earlsdon House  became the HQ of his own company, Coventry Gauge  &amp; Tool Ltd. </p>
			  <p>Joseph died in  Somerset but his grave is in London Road Cemetery. His business Joseph White  &amp; Son continued in Earlsdon Street into the 1930s as watch and chronometer  makers.<strong></strong></p>
