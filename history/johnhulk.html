			    <span class="image_caption">1861 Census records John Hulk and family in Cromwell Street </span></p>
			  <p>John Hulk was born in Coventry in 1831 and apprenticed to Thomas Hill in the city in 1844. In 1853 he took out a mortgage for £250 from the Coventry and Warwickshire Benefit Building and Investment Society, with which he bought a plot of land on Cromwell Street (now Berkeley Road South), and on which he had a house built. This mortgage, considerable at the time, was added to by a further £54.15s.0d in order that the building could be completed. The repayments on what was then, to a young artisan such as Hulk, a very large weekly expense, must have placed a heavy burden on him, and he would have been hard pushed, with a wife and family to support, to make ends meet. Unfortunately the way out of his difficulties which he chose was bound to fail. There was a tendency among some masters and manufacturers to take on a large number of apprentices, not with the intention of training them to become good craftsmen in their own right, but merely to exploit them as cheap labour - a practice not unknown in other industries - and for which the Coventry trade was notorious.</p>
			  <p>Hulk took the apprentices and called himself a 'manufacturer' and one can easily imagine the quality of the watches he produced. His business was doomed to failure, and in October 1857 he had to borrow a further £150 from an uncle, William Hulk, Beerseller of Coventry. He lasted a further six and a half years, but in March 1864 the Building Society was forced to foreclose on his mortgage, his Earlsdon property was sold and John Hulk disappeared from the watchmaking records.</p>
