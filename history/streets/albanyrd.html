			  <p>Albany Road was started in mid-January 1898 and should, by the terms of the contract, have been completed by 10  July.  In fact it was only completed on 16  September 1898. Officially opened a few months later on 1 December 1898, it was named after the Duchess of   Albany following her visit to St. Thomas's Church in November 1898.&nbsp; Its construction     was in order to pump prime new life into Earlsdon which that had suffered from its   earliest days from poor communication with Coventry. There   were no direct roads and the shortest route was via a footpath (<a href="../jetty.html">Earlsdon Jetty</a>) that was the   basis for Albany Road. The City Council had started to organise a road to Earlsdon in 1890 but&nbsp;was delayed  through problems&nbsp;negotiating with local land owners.  </p>
			  <p> The new road made the creation of a tram service   possible. This started in March 1905 which further increased the interest in   Earlsdon as a suburb. Developers needed no encouragement to feed a building boom   in the area during the years leading up to the First World War.&nbsp;</p>

		        <span class="image_caption">Further development of Albany Road following the First World War </span></p>
			  <p>This view of Albany Road is taken part way down from the centre of Earlsdon, looking towards the Butts. Trams are still   passing up and down this road but other motor traffic is now beginning to be a   more common sight. The Edwardian terraces have been joined by later additions   from the 1920s on the left-hand side of the road, filling the few gaps that are   left. The blinds on shop fronts and the shadows suggest sunny weather at midday.   This busy road displays first signs of the moving and parked motor traffic that   blights modern day Earlsdon, but a couple of bicycles and a horse drawn van   still remind us of the relatively peaceful time of less than a decade   earlier.</p>
