			  <h1>A brief history of Earlsdon </h1>
			  <p><img src="images/c00953.jpg" alt="Earlsdon Crossroads" width="640" height="400" class="image_rounded" /></p>
			  <p>The districts known as   Asthill and Horwell lay in the south-west of St. Michael's parish, mainly to the   east of the stream which runs south from Hearsall Common to Canley Ford. There   was a well here called Horwell or Whorwell from at least the 14th century, and   the stream has been called Horwell stream or the Whor (or Hor) Brook. Asthill   was the land rising east of the Whor Brook and south from <a href="hearsallcommon.html">Hearsall Common</a> towards Stivichall Common, which has   been included in the modern Earlsdon. The roads called Asthill Grove and Asthill   Croft, east of Warwick Road, may mark the eastern extremity of this district. </p>
			  <p align="left">Horwell as the name for a locality has disappeared, and has been replaced for   some purposes by that of Hearsall. Except for Hearsall Common, Hearsall Golf   Course, and some playing fields the whole area is occupied by houses of the 19th   century and later.</p>
			  <p align="left">In the 14th century the   boundary of the inner liberties of the city ran from Stivichall through Aylesden   (Earlsdon) Field and Blackorchard Field to Guphill Ford, so including the   north-east of Asthill in the city. After the dissolution of the county of the   city in 1842 the railway line from Coventry to Birmingham, which crosses the   area south of Hearsall Common, became the boundary of the new municipal borough.   The land north of the railway therefore remained in the city, and the rest of   the two districts was taken into the city in the boundary extension of   1890.</p>
			  <p align="left">Hearsall Common and   strips of common along Earlsdon Lane and Whor Lane were inclosed in the Coventry   commons' inclosure of 1875, some parts being allotted to the corporation and   others sold. Land south of the railway and west of Earlsdon Lane was bought for   building in 1853. This was laid out with streets and partly built up, forming   the detached suburb of Earlsdon which was occupied mainly by <a href="/history/watchtrail.html">watchmakers</a>.   Further to the southeast, near Warwick Road and Kenilworth Road, there were some   large houses in their own grounds by 1887. This area was evidently becoming one   of the most favoured residential districts of Coventry. <a href="spencerpark.html">Spencer Park</a>, immediately south of the railway, was   opened in 1883 and the new King Henry VIII School, with its playing fields   adjoining the park, was built in 1885. By 1906 the former watchmaking suburb had   spread southwards between Whor Lane and Earlsdon Lane, over land which had   belonged to Earlsdon Farm. To the west, by the Hor Brook, was a horticultural   nursery, later called Earlsdon Rose Nursery. </p>
			  <p align="left">By the First World War   there were more houses, some with large gardens, to the east of Earlsdon Lane,   while in the west Hearsall Golf Course was laid out. Meanwhile building to the   north of the railway had joined Earlsdon to the mid-19th-century development at   Chapel Fields. Immediately after the war scattered building development began   west of Whor Lane when the districts on both sides of the Hor Brook became known   as Beechwood, Canley, and Westwood Gardens. Earlsdon Lane and Whor Lane were   straightened and renamed <a href="streets/earlsdonaves.html">Earlsdon Avenue</a> and   Beechwood Avenue respectively. The many gardens and the survival of Stivichall   Common, well planted with trees, had always given the southern part of the   district a leafy appearance. This was increased by the opening of the War   Memorial Park beyond Kenilworth Road in 1921. In spite of more building,   sometimes in the grounds of older houses, and the erection of an eleven-story   block of flats between Kenilworth Road and Asthill Grove the character of this   area has still been maintained.</p>
