			  <p>Earlsdon does not have parish council, of course, but this walk follows the old tradition of 'beating the bounds' and takes in a variety of green spaces around the edges of Earlsdon 'parish'. This is a very long circular walk. Beginning at the Earlsdon clock the route takes in the the ancient Hearsall Common and Canley Ford and the more   modern War Memorial Park. The walk ends with the Edwardian developments of Top Park and Spencer Park before returning you to the centre of Earlsdon.</p>
			  <p align="left"><strong>Route:</strong></p>
			  <p>1. We begin at the Earsldon Clock at   the junction of Albany Road, Earlsdon Street and Earlsdon Avenue. The clock marks what many consider to be the heart of Earlsdon. The clock was erected in 1990 by local subscription and replaces a tram clock which stood on the roundabout until the 1980’s.</p>
			  <p>2. Proceed along Earlsdon Avenue North to  <a href="hearsallcommon.html">Hearsall Common</a> at the Old Clarence Inn. This pub was   originally opened purely as an off-sales outlet by trick cyclist Sam Brown at   the outbreak of the First World War. From the Clarence head diagonally across   the common to the junction of Canley Road with Hearsall Common Road and cross straight ahead, making for the cycle speedway track. Carry on to the woodland, keeping the allotments and the old hedgerows on your right; as you enter the   wood look for the pond restored by Wildlife Trust volunteers.</p>

		      <span class="image_caption">Hearsall Common</span></p>
			  <p>Veering to the right, continue   through scrubland at the back of Whoberley Avenue making for the sharp corner at   Guphill Avenue. Turn left here and pass through mature woodland parallel with   Guphill Avenue (often very muddy); wildlife enthusiasts have placed numerous   nesting boxes in the trees; look out for jays, sparrowhawks, owls, tree creepers   and woodpeckers. The trail now crosses Broad Lane and continues alongside an old   hedgerow to reach the dual carriageway at Tile Hill Lane.  Cross over and   continue along another hedgerow to Canley Road and follow the road over the   railway, pausing to admire the allotment gardens.</p>
			  <p>3. Continue along Beechwood Avenue which bends round to   the right and reach the sharp left turn.  Walk ahead along Bates Road and at the   bottom of the hill take to the narrow footpath cutting through Hearsall Golf   Course. Soon we reach the site of the old Canley Milk Bar where milkshakes, ice   creams and afternoon teas are sadly but a memory. At the lane turn right to the   ford. This is a very ancient sunken lane worn down by centuries of carts. By the   ford there are a set of steps on the left.  These lead to the nature reserve   created by Friends of Canley Ford.  On the meadow is an impressive metal   sculpture of a kestrel. Follow the path to a gate.</p>

			  <p align="left">			    4. On returning to the lane turn   right and follow the lane to Kenilworth Road. Cross over Kenilworth Road and   enter Coat of Arms Bridge Road. This area is what remains of Styvechale Common.   At the junction of Green Lane continue along Coat of Arms Bridge Road and enter   the War Memorial Park through a gate on the left. </p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/walks/warmemorial.jpg" alt="War Memorial Park" width="187" height="249" class="image_rounded" /><br />
			    <span class="image_caption">The War Memorial </span></p>
			  <p>5. There are numerous routes through   the park. Pick your own and head for the large art deco memorial. From the   memorial continue along the boulevard to the main gate at the junction of   Kenilworth Road and Leamington Road. </p>
			  <p>6. Cross here and enter Top Green. This well   kept Edwardian Park was where local residents would once promenade. </p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/walks/topgreen.jpg" alt="Top Green" width="515" height="640" class="image_rounded" /><br />
                  <span class="image_caption">Top Green,   drinking fountain </span></p>
			  <p>7. Continue through the Park to Spencer Road and turn left. Continue   along Spencer Road to <a href="spencerpark.html">Spencer Park</a>.   The Park consists of a formal Edwardian park with tennis courts and bowling   greens, together with a pavilion which is crying out for restoration. </p>
			  <p>8. On the   opposite side of the road is an informal park surrounded by fine trees. Take the   tree lined path around this section of the park turning left at the railway   footbridge. Known locally as ‘Anarchy Bridge’ this has been a favourite haunt   for graffiti artists for many decades. </p>
			  <p>Finally the path will lead to back to <a href="streets/albanyrd.html">Albany Road</a> where you turn left   again to bring you back to the Earlsdon Clock.</p>
