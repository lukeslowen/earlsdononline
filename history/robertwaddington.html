		      <span class="image_caption">Robert Waddington at his 'Wythburn' home abt 1910 </span> </p>
			  <p>Robert Waddington was born in 1845 and was an immigrant from the Liverpool area. After serving an apprenticeship there he became a dealer in watch making materials and developed a growing trade with the Coventry watchmakers. He became friendly with one of his customers and mixing business with pleasure brought his family down to stay on several occasions. His wife's health - she was asthmatic - was always so much better when they were in Coventry that it was decided that they should move here permanently, so a house was built on Earlsdon Terrace, 'Wythburn', and they took up residence there in 1878. Waddington had a house built with a workshop at the rear and there he started his business as a manufacturer. He also had an interest in the city trade, being one of the original directors of the Coventry Watch Movement Company, which was formed in 1889. Twelve years later, in 1901, he became Chairman, holding the post until his death in 1918. He was a Coventry City  councillor in 1890. Robert’s grave is  in London Road, Cemetery.</p>
